<h2>
"You are cordially invited to participate in a game of thrills and dares. Tell no one, and come alone. If you dare.

Hope is sick of everyone treating her like she's breakable. Sure, she has cystic fibrosis (basically really bad lungs), but she's tired of being babied by her mom and her overprotective best friend, Ethan, not to mention worrying about paying for her expensive medication and how she's going to afford college. And she's bored with life in her run-down New Orleans suburb.

When an invitation arrives from a mysterious group that calls itself the Society, Hope jumps at the chance for some excitement. This could be her ticket out. All she has to do is complete a few dares and she might win some real money.

But the Society isn't all it seems . . . and soon Hope finds that playing the game isn't a choice—it's a requirement."</h2>
