<li> The title : "Dance Dance"</li>
<h2>"High-class call girls billed to Mastercard. A psychic 13-year-old dropout with a passion for Talking Heads. A hunky matinee idol doomed to play dentists and teachers. A one-armed beach-combing poet, an uptight hotel clerk and one very bemused narrator caught in the web of advanced capitalist mayhem. Combine this offbeat cast of characters with Murakami's idiosyncratic prose and out comes Dance Dance Dance."</h2>
<li> The auther: "Haruki Murakami"</li> 
 <li>Language: "English"</li> 
<li> Genres :"Novel"</li>
